# Gathering Plugin
This plugin was made by Cyumus Aduni and later modified by Thadah Denyse

The gathering plugin is designed to allow players to gather resources from rocks or trees. To set up new itemTables, go to the local gatherItems table and set a new table inside ["rock"] or ["tree"] just like the ["default"] itemTables. Adding new entities isn't supported yet.

To set a rock or tree spawner, just do /gatherspawnadd [entity] [table]
Example: 
/gatherspawnadd tree default
